As the technology is growing at a fast pace, it is now time demand to transform the non-portable hardware based or microcontroller-based vehicle tracking system into a simple, portable, cost effective automated vehicle tracking system. This paper describes the development of an android based vehicle tracking student friendly application (app). After implementation the vehicle tracking app is named VTS-NSTU (Vehicle Tracking System-Noakhali Science and Technology University). The implemented app can run with the help of GPS and Google Map Application Programming Interface (API) to locate the campus vehicles. GPS radio receiver takes the updated longitude and latitude of every position"s information for every second and to store them in Google"s Firebase Server. In the driver side, the phone will continuously send the updated longitude and latitude information to the firebase. In the user (student) side application, coordinates are fetched from the database and are shown in the user-side android application. The implemented appis tested for the trip from Choumuhani Chowrasta to NSTU campus. Using the application, the user (students) can see the real time location of the vehicles of NSTU with sufficient accuracy. The delay time is 1-2 seconds for the 4G network after initializing the app.
